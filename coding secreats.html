<h4>coding languges i recomend to learn</h4>
 <li><strong>Java,</strong><br> if your a mincraft fan you will love this program, your are able to start making mincraft mods and this is what mincraft commands are based off of if im correct, so you will actully understand mincraft commands!.</li> <li><strong>Python,</strong><br> this language is good if your a beginerr and since the people who made python new they wont have every thing you need theres this neet feture: <br> if you type import then the name of any python comutity you (you can find this on google) such as pygame it will import the entirety of there code into your pyhton ide then what ever code there comutity has it will be added to your framwork longs the code is under the import. (if you type from then the name and the thing you want it will only import that spicif thing).</li> <li>HTML, <br>this is ironic i am learning html by making a website that includes why you should learn html.<br> <strong>HTML</strong> is a language used to make websits with basic text and your able to change these text with the same changes like google docs such as bold or a list. <strong>But</strong> there is some major limitations such as interacting if you want your website to say have a real time clock or timer then now you need to learn java script a whole new languege, evan worse if you want more then just black on white text you need to learn CSS another whole new languege if you wanted to add things like colors, logos and pop. But its easy and fun 'cause its manly just coming up with things to have your website say.</li>
